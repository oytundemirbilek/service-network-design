        "# 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is no longer just a concept—billions of dollars in global investment and numerous pilot projects show it is on the verge of commercial rollout. In February 2024, Archer Aviation announced successful flight tests of its ‘Midnight’ eVTOL with FAA oversight, moving the aircraft closer to commercial readiness. Meanwhile, Joby Aviation continues to secure key approvals, highlighting how eVTOL services could soon become operational in major cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among these urban centers, New York City stands out as an ideal early launch market, thanks to its extreme congestion, existing heliport infrastructure, and high willingness-to-pay among residents, tourists, and business travelers. Yet to fully tap into NYC’s potential, a well-designed service network is crucial—operators must determine which routes to fly, how often to operate, and how to balance costs and demand. This case study focuses on those network design considerations, offering insights into route selection, scheduling, pricing strategies, and the infrastructure constraints that will shape the next generation of urban air travel.\n",
